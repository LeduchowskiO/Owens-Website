This is a WIP.
Primarily seeking to keep my skills honed, gain some familiarity with newer versions of the technologies than I use in my career to prepare for future upgrades, and just make a habit of doing some coding on my own time.
Simple project with minimal complexity to be easy to stay commited to working on regularly - I'm typically like to take on other hobbies after a days work of coding, but would like the practice and am starting off by creating a habit of doing a little bit every couple of days.

Hopefully bigger projects to come in the future
